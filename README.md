I used :
* The data set  **Online Retail II** from <a href="https://openclassrooms.com">UCI Machine Learning repository</a>  that contains all the transactions occurring for a UK-based and registered, non-store online retail between **01/12/2009** and **09/12/2011**.The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gift-ware. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.
* I also download from this  <a href="https://openclassrooms.com">website</a> , the longitude and latitude of each country in my data set **retail online II** to make map charts.

I have used this data to create a visualization tool that will allow us to observe the underlying trends and thus facilitate decision-making.
I also did machine learning algorithms such as clustering to identify different groups in the data set, time series algorithms to predict commands over time.
